# etch_a_sketch

This another beginner project to improve my knowledge of Javascript, more importantly manipulating the DOM. In this project, a grid will be created through the DOM instead of using standard HTML. Also, an Event Listener along with some CSS will be used in order to create the etch-a-sketch effect.
